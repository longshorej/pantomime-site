<h2>Integration / Futures</h2>

<p>Pantomime provides integration with the <a href="https://docs.rs/futures">futures</a>
  crate. Futures can be spawned by dispatchers, and their results can be piped to
  actors.</p>

<p class="note">Futures integration is provided by the <em class="code">futures-support</em>
  feature, which is enabled by default.</p>

<h4>Spawning Futures</h4>

<p>Any <em class="code">Dispatcher</em> can spawn <em class="code">Future</em>s and drive
  them to completion. The following demonstrates how to do this, using the <em class="code">spawn</em>
  method.</p>

<h4>Piping Futures</h4>

<p>The <em class="code">pipe_to</em> method can be used to message the
  result of a <em class="code">Future</em> to an actor. For example:

<pre><code class="language-rust">use pantomime::prelude::*;

// Note: In reality, these would be real futures / actors
let my_actor: ActorRef<usize> = ActorRef::empty();
let my_future = future::ok(42);

context.spawn_future(
  my_future.pipe_to(my_actor)
);
</code></pre>
