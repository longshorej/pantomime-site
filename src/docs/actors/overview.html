<h2>Actors / Overview</h2>

<p>Actors are the building blocks of Pantomime. An actor is a stateful computation abstraction based on the principal
  of message passing. When an actor receives a message, it may mutate its internal state, spawn child actors,
  and message other actors.</p>

<h4>Concepts</h4>

<dl>
  <dt>Actor</dt>
  <dd>An actor receives messages and signals, and processes them serially. Upon receipt of a message or signal,
    it may mutate its own state and spawn other actors. Actors are lightweight -- you can have millions of them
    on a modest system.</dd>

  <dt>Dispatcher</dt>
  <dd>A dispatcher is responsible for executing thunks of work. For example, this may include executing an actor
    when it is messaged, or invoking a function that was previously scheduled. An actor may specify a custom
    dispatcher if it has particular execution requirements. For instance, an actor that performs blocking I/O
    may wish to be executed on a dispatcher that is reserved for blocking operations, to prevent starving the
    primary dispatcher.</dd>

  <dt>Mailbox</dt>
  <dd>When an actor is messaged, the message is placed in a mailbox. By default, actors are assigned to a shard
    to share common infrastructure and reduce memory consumption. An actor may specify a custom mailbox implementation
    if it wishes to control the delivery semantics, for instance message priority.</dd>

  <dt>Shard</dt>
  <dd>A shard consists of a mailbox and a number of actors. The number of shards is determined at runtime by
    configuration, but is static in that once the system has been started, the number of shards cannot change. If
    an actor specifies a custom dispatcher or mailbox, it is placed in its own shard.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Defining Actors</h4>

<p>To define an actor, declare a struct with the state that your actor contains, and
implement the <em class="code">Actor</em> trait for the message type that your actor can receive.</p>

<h5>Receiving Messages</h5>

When defining an actor, you must declare the <em class="code">receive</em> method. When an actor is
messaged, this method will be called with the message instance.

<h5>Receiving Signals</h5>

An actor may also define a <em class="code">receive_signal</em> method. This can be used to react to
lifecycle notifications. For example, when an actor is spawned, this method will be invoked with a
<em class="code">Signal::Started</em> message.

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The following example shows a simple actor that maintains a counter. When it receives a <em class="code">GetAndAdd</em>
  message, it replies with the current value of the counter and then adds the supplied value.</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use pantomime::prelude::*;

enum CountingMsg {
  GetAndAdd(u64, ActorRef&lt;u64&gt;)
}

struct CountingActor {
  value: u64
}

impl Actor&lt;CountingMsg&gt; for CountingActor {
  fn receive(&amp;mut self, msg: CountingMsg, _: ActorContext&lt;CountingMsg&gt;) {
    match msg {
      CountingMsg::GetAndAdd(value, reply_to) =&gt; {
        reply_to.tell(self.value);
        self.value += value;
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Creating an ActorSystem</h4>

<p>An <em class="code">ActorSystem</em> contains all of the machinery required to spawn and execute actors. This involves
  spawning a small number of threads for executing the actors (related to available CPUs), a thread to handle I/O events,
  a thread to generate timer ticks, and a thread to handle actor system events.</p>

<p>A typical application will create an <em class="code">ActorSystem</em> in its <em class="code">main</em> function,
  spawn any root actors it needs, and then invoke <em class="code">join</em> to start handling system events. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use pantomime::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  // create an ActorSystem
  let mut system = ActorSystem::new();

  // use system.spawn(..) to spawn your root actors, e.g.
  // system.spawn(MyActor);
  // system.spawn(MyOtherActor);

  // use this thread to handle system messages
  system.join();
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Spawning Actors</h4>

<h5>Root</h5>

<p>Root actors are top-level actors without parents. The only difference
  from child actors is how they are spawned. Instead of calling <em class="code">spawn</em>
  on an <em class="code">ActorContext</em>, root actors are spawned by calling <em class="code">spawn</em>
  on an <em class="code">ActorSystem</em>.

<h5>Child</h5>

<p>Child actors are spawned from within other actors. To do this, <em class="code">spawn</em> is called
  on the actor's <em class="code">ActorContext</em>.
