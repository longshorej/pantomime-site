<h2>Actors / Overview</h2>

<p>Actors are the building blocks of Pantomime. An actor is a stateful computation abstraction based on the principal
  of message passing. When an actor receives a message, it may mutate its internal state, spawn child actors,
  and message other actors.</p>

<h4>Concepts</h4>

<dl>
  <dt>Actor</dt>
  <dd>An actor receives messages of a specified type and processes them serially.</dd>

  <dt>Dispatcher</dt>
  <dd>A dispatcher is responsible for executing thunks of work. For example, this may include executing an actor
    when it is messaged, or invoking a function that was previously scheduled. An actor may specify a custom
    dispatcher if it has particular execution requirements. For instance, an actor that performs blocking I/O
    may wish to be executed on a dispatcher that is reserved for blocking operations, to prevent starving the
    primary dispatcher.</dd>

  <dt>Mailbox</dt>
  <dd>When an actor is messaged, the message is placed in a mailbox. By default, actors are assigned to a shard
    to share common infrastructure and reduce memory consumption. An actor may specify a custom mailbox implementation
    if it wishes to control the delivery semantics, for instance message priority.</dd>

  <dt>Shard</dt>
  <dd>A shard consists of a mailbox and a number of actors. The number of shards is determined at runtime by
    configuration, but is static in that once the system has been started, the number of shards cannot change. If
    an actor specifies a custom dispatcher or mailbox, it is placed in its own shard.</dd>
