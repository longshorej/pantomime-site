<h2>Actors / Supervision</h2>

<h4>Failure &amp; Supervisors</h4>

<p>If an actor panics while executing, it will be stopped. To
facilitate this, actors must be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/trait.UnwindSafe.html">UnwindSafe</a>.</p>

<p>Actors may be wrapped with <em class="code">Supervisor</em> that can
restart the actor (resetting state) or resuming the actor (keeping state).</p>

<p>The following demonstrates this feature:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use pantomime::prelude::*;

</code></pre>

<h4>Watching Actors</h4>

<p>An actor may use <em class="code">ActorContext::watch</em> to be
  notified when other actors terminate, whether due to normal termination
  or failure.</p>

<p>When an actor is terminated, all actors that are watching it are notified
with a <em class="code">StopReason</em> signal indicating the reason why.</p>

<p>The following demonstrates this feature:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use pantomime::prelude::*;

</code></pre>
