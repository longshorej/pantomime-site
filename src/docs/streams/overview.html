<h2>Streams / Overview</h2>

<p>Pantomime provides a powerful streaming library that is built on top of
  its actor API.</p>

<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a>
  initiative, Pantomime Streams is a dynamic push-pull streaming
  abstraction that uses actors as the primary concurrency mechanism.</p>

<h4>Concepts</h4>

<p>To understand Pantomime Streams, a few key concepts and terms must
 be introduced. You'll find the following terms referenced throughout the
 documentation.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Stage</dt>
  <dd>The basic building block is a <em>stage</em> which has a variable
    number of inputs and outputs.</dd>

  <dt>Source</dt>
  <dd>An originating stage that has zero inputs and one output, its <em>downstream</em>.</dd>

  <dt>Flow</dt>
  <dd>A processing stage that has one input (<em>upstream</em>) and one output (<em>downstream</em>).</dd>

  <dt>Sink</dt>
  <dd>A terminating stage that has one input (<em>upstream</em>) and zero outputs.</dd>

  <dt>Backpressure &amp; Demand</dt>
  <dd>Downstream sends asynchronous demand signals upstream indicating that it wishes to receive more elements.
    This prevents the producer from overloading the consumer, a concept known as <em>backpressure</em>. Efficiency
    is retained by inserting buffers between asynchronous boundaries to amortize message passing overhead</dd>
